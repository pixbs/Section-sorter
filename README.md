Section sorter
=
A simple widget for Figma(mainly) and FigJam to align your layers (auto-layout-like) inside your pages/sections/frames

How to:
-
* Add the widget to your Figma or FigJam page
* Place your widget inside the page/section/frame
* Select the direction for auto alignment (horizontal or vertical)
* Select the gap between elements
* Press update

How does sorting work?
-
* The widget sorts every element in the section/frame/page where he is located
* Sorting order is the order of its parent (the order of layers is the order of sorting)

With what elements it interacts?
-
* The widget works inside a page, section, or frame

* And will sort and align only: sections, frames, groups, sticky nodes, components, and component sets; the widget will ignore any other type of element such as instance, rectangle, text, etc.

Property menu:
-
* You can switch between a dark and light theme
* You can hide and show controls (sort direction, gap)

Roadmap
* Release (you are here)
* Smart headline (will take the name of the parent element)
* Child counter (will count how many child elements are inside the section, and separate it by group)
* Status bar
* A customizable visual of the widget (such as color, corner-radius, and fonts)
